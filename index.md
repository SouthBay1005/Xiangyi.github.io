## Welcome to My Pages

My name is Xiangyi, 21 years old. I am currently studying for a Ph.D. at Nanjing University of Science and Technology,with a focus on information science.

I am very interested in technology, if you are interested in c++, python programming, or are learning deep learning, we can communicate more. I'm trying to build a solid foundation in these areas and hope to do well during my Ph.D.

### Research Direction
